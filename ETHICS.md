## A. Data Collection
 - [ ] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?
 - [ ] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?
 - [ ] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?
 - [ ] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?

## B. Data Storage
 - [ ] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?
 - [ ] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?
 - [ ] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?

## C. Analysis
 - [ ] **C.6 Well-Posed Problem**: Is it possible to answer the question with data? Is the problem well-posed?
